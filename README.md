# My Annotation Scripts

These are just some scripts and settings to help me annotate lectures.

## Gromit-MPX

I'm using Gromit-MPX for live screen annotations, as Zoom is sometimes buggy. The configuration file present just contains the pens and eraser I like to use.

## Scripts

Misc scripts to help setup things. So far this is just a "drawpad-setup" script which will configure the drawpad/pen buttons to my liking, then limit the stylus pen to only one monitor. Takes CLI args to account for differences between workstations.
